# 📚 FullStack Open 2025 Exercises

This repository contains solutions to exercises from the [FullStack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course, which covers modern web development using JavaScript, React, Node.js, GraphQL, TypeScript, CI/CD, containers, and more.

## 🚀 Purpose

I'm using this space to:

- Deepen my understanding of full-stack development
- Explore modern frontend and backend frameworks
- Reinforce data handling skills with RESTful APIs and MongoDB
- Solidify my command of testing, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization

## 📌 Background & Motivation

As a Senior Data Integration Engineer, I’ve spent over a decade designing and building dynamic frontends using Ignition's Perspective module. My work has spanned MES/SCADA environments, where I was often the go-to engineer for tackling new challenges—especially when existing tools couldn’t meet the need.

That adaptability is one of my greatest strengths. Whether it was building custom solutions outside Ignition’s capabilities or diving into new tech stacks, I’ve always thrived in roles that let me learn on the job and deliver fast, reliable results.

This repo reflects my continued growth into full-stack development. I began this course after a recruiter reached out about a Full Stack Software Engineer role, and while I wasn’t selected, the experience clarified how much I enjoy building across the stack—and how much value I can bring to teams looking for versatile engineers who learn fast and execute well.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The exercises will touch on:

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB
