# 📚 FullStack Open 2025 Exercises

This repository contains solutions to exercises from the [FullStack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course, which covers modern web development using JavaScript, React, Node.js, GraphQL, TypeScript, CI/CD, containers, and more.

## 🚀 Purpose

I'm using this space to:

- Deepen my understanding of full-stack development
- Explore modern frontend and backend frameworks
- Reinforce data handling skills with RESTful APIs and MongoDB
- Solidify my command of testing, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization

## 📌 Background & Motivation

As a Data Integration Engineer, I’ve spent over a decade designing and building dynamic frontends using Ignition's Perspective module. My experience includes data-driven UI composition, scripting for interactive visualizations, and creating responsive dashboards across MES/SCADA environments.

While Perspective is tailored for industrial automation, it shares key principles with modern frontend frameworks—component-based architecture, reactive data flows, and user-centric design. This repository reflects my transition into React and broader web technologies to apply those principles in scalable and user-facing web applications.
